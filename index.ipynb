    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Four main datatypes in SQLite3 are:\n",
    "1. Text- The SQLite equivalent of a string. Typically uses encodings such as UTF-8.\n",
    "2. Integer - These are signed integer values. Up to 8 bytes can be used to store the integer value, depending on how large it is.\n",
    "3. Real- The SQLite equivalent of a Float value like we would see in python, REAL values are used to store decimal numbers.\n",
    "4. Blob- Exactly as it sounds, a 'blob' of data that is stored exactly as it was input. For instance, if we stored an image in a SQLite database, it would be stored as a BLOB, and would not be touched or changed in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key-foreign key relationship defines a one-to-many relationship between two tables in a relational database. A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that references the primary key columns in another table. The primary key is defined as a column (or set of columns) where each value is unique and identifies a single row of the table.  JOIN statements work by matching up rows where the foreign key in one table matches the primary key for a row (or rows) in a different table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "- One to One Relationships\n",
    "- One to Many and Many to One Relationships\n",
    "- Many to Many Relationships\n",
    "- Self Referencing Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross Joins\n",
    "Natural Joins\n",
    "Inner Joins\n",
    "Left (Outer) Joins\n",
    "Right (Outer) Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate functions can be used in conjunction with GROUP BY statements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
